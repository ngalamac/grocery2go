# Conversation Continuation Log - G2G Marketplace Setup

**Conversation ID:** bc-5604aba0-3abc-45b3-aae4-640a90afdc87  
**Date:** October 17, 2024  
**Status:** Completed Successfully

## Overview

This document captures the continuation of a conversation where the G2G Marketplace full-stack e-commerce application was successfully set up, configured, and tested. The application includes both frontend (React/TypeScript) and backend (Node.js/TypeScript) components with third-party integrations.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing Environment Configuration
**Problem:** No `.env` files existed for either backend or frontend
**Solution:** Created proper environment files with necessary configuration

**Backend `.env`:**
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-in-production
NODE_ENV=development
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
```

**Frontend `.env`:**
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 2. Port Conflict Issue
**Problem:** Backend was trying to use port 26053 instead of 5000
**Root Cause:** Environment variable `PORT=26053` was set in the system
**Solution:** 
- Unset the conflicting PORT variable
- Explicitly set `PORT=5000` for the backend
- Verified server starts correctly on port 5000

### 3. Dependency Installation
**Problem:** Node modules not installed
**Solution:** Ran `npm install` in both directories
- Backend: 174 packages installed
- Frontend: 303 packages installed
